## Introduction
Suicides have become increasingly concerning and have received a lot of attention in today's society. Suicides are regarded to be most frequently caused by depression. Other factors to consider include economic factors, societal factors and incurable diseases. Chatbots based on AI have been developed to prevent people from committing suicide, although their accuracy is only about 75%. To reduce the number of suicide attempts in the future, we must employ machine learning algorithms to accurately anticipate suicide attempts. Preliminary data analysis would reveal suicide numbers as well as the relationship between various factors and the amount to which they contribute. To better comprehend the trends in suicide attempts, a graphical representation would be presented. Several Python libraries will be used, and multiple models will be constructed to see which model has the least error. This research investigates how suicide rates and the factors that influence them can be predicted using machine learning algorithms. 
## Importance of current study
* The World Health Organization estimates that 800,000 people die by suicide each year, making it the 18th biggest cause of death. Suicide was the tenth largest cause of death in the United States in 2018, resulting to a decrease in average life expectancy in the United States. Suicide is a global phenomenon that affects people of all ages. According to some estimates, for every adult who died by suicide, more than 20 others attempted suicide. Suicide is a worldwide problem; in 2016, 79 percent of suicides took place in low- and middle-income nations.
* People today suffer from serious physical and psychological diseases because of a range of internal and external circumstances. Although depression is more common in people in their 30s and 40s, it can also be found in children and the elderly due to academic stress and interpersonal relationships. Because people with mental illnesses are stigmatized in society, they frequently conceal their sickness. Self-harm and suicide attempts are also influenced by economic conditions and drug and alcohol usage.
* The first step in suicide prevention can be thought of as a categorization task aimed at precisely identifying persons who are at risk of suicide within a given time frame, allowing for preventive action. However, the greatest meta-analysis of suicide prediction looked at 365 researches and found that predictions based on individual risk or protective factors had poor predictive accuracy and have improved little over time.
## Expectations from current study
* Data analysis is performed in order to classify data so that a set of preventive measures can be implemented in the future. This can provide information on the causes of suicide in a specific state and year. The dataset can also show whether the suicide rate for a specific cause has increased or decreased. Not only will analysis and classification give preventative strategies, but they will also enable comparisons to determine whether the suicide incidence has increased or decreased over time. The findings of this study could be applied to a variety of approaches to solve the problem. A thorough investigation was conducted into global suicide information. The following chapters are methodically designed to provide the reader with an organized interpretation.
* Early identification of people who are at risk of suicide is critical for suicide prevention. Machine learning is emerging as a possible strategy for achieving this goal. The aim of our research is to develop a machine learning model for predicting suicide attempts. Some of the models employed are K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Regression. The effectiveness of these algorithms is compared in this study.
## Dataset and analysis 
* The Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016 dataset which is taken from Kaggle consists of 27820 rows and 12 columns. It is compiled from four different datasets (United Nations Development Program (HDI), World Bank, World Health Organization, and Szmali) to identify any attributes that correlated with suicide rates globally. The data is readily available and downloadable in CSV format.
* Some of the columns are numerical types which include GDP per capita, HDI for year, suicides_no, while others like country, age, sex, generation etc. are categorical. 
* Unit of analysis for our project would be countries. Over 100 countires would be analyzed.
* We will be using GDP per capita , HDI, age, sex, generation in our analysis.
* Many data mining techniques will be utilized to uncover hidden trends in the dataset and determine the correlation between variables, as well as plot multiple graphs to uncover trends in suicide rates and identify the many causes that contribute to suicide.
* K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost Regression and Multilayer Perceptrons are the models I plan on using.
* The Evaluation Metrics used would be accuracy and RMSE scores. 
## Outcomes intended to achieve 
* This analysis is aimed at explaining how different machine learning algorithms can be used in predicting suicide rates based on relevant factors collected in the dataset.
* The analysis carried out will also provide knowledge about areas of improvement to the government and other organizations working towards suicide prevention and counselling so that effective steps can be taken.
## Additional research 
* I plan on performing Sentiment Analysis on the tweet data to have a clear picture of what tweets have the most tendency to be 
related to suicide or depression. The sentences or phrases are classified to be positive or negative, positive if it is 
related to suicide or depression.
* The data for sentiment analysis would be taken from https://www.vicinitas.io/free-tools/download-search-tweets and downloaded into a csv file.
* Around 2000 recent tweets can be extracted by using hashtags or keywords. Preprocessing will be done by removing special characters and turning the text into lowercase. PorterStemmer would be used to stem the words for better analyzations. Tokenizing and Vectorizing would be done to fit the data into the model. SGDClassifier will be used to predict if a certain text is positive or negative. From genism, Word2Vec is used to vectorize the words.
